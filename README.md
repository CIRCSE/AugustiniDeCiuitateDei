Augustini De Ciuitate Dei

*De Ciuitate Dei* is a prose work in 22 books, preceded by a short letter, by Augustine of Hippo. It was written in the 5th century AD. The work describes two societies: one consists of the elect, that is the city of God, whereas the other consists of the damned, that is the city of man. Books 1-10 detail how pagan communities conceived divine powers. Books 11-22 provide a theological interpretation of the history of humankind. 

The source of the Latin text is The Latin Library (http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/august.html).
